# jupyter
Various jupyter notebooks

## Butterworth.ipynb

This is a butterworth low pass IIR filter design that utilizes the bilinear transform.


## RandomPick.ipynb

A simple script that randomly picks list elements, there are fancier ways of doing it in python but this was a prototype for something to be done in GDscript.


## Butterworthhigh.ipynb

High pass version of the low pass butterworth filter from Butterworth.ipynb


## FIR_filter.ipynb

FIR filter design.


## Interpolator.ipynb

Some interpolation and filtering.


## Fractals.ipynb

An old notebook I made to plot images of fractals based on the Make Your Own Mandelbrot book by Rashid, which is an awesome book.  I was learning python and jupyter at the time, so the code is pretty rough.


## ConvexHull.ipynb

Code to find the vertices of a convex hull of a set of points.  Based on an algorithm from Computational Geometry by de Berg et. al.


## KalmanExample8.ipynb

This is a replication of example 8 from Kalmanfilter.net.


## KalmanExample8-Experiment.ipynb

Tried using a sine wave for the target motion, found that process noise must be adjusted considerably and the tracking still isn't great.


## DelaunayVoronoi.ipynb

Voronoi diagram generator from Dive Into Algorithms by Tuckfield.  Can also be used to create Delaunay triangle mesh.  I modified things so that
I could recreate the diagrams in GDscript, which at this point doesn't appear to support complex numbers and list comprehension that were used
in the original algorithm.
